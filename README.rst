`cti-taxii-client`
====================

NOTE: This is an `OASIS Open Repository <https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/>`_. See the `Governance`_ section for more information.

cti-taxii-client is a minimal implementation of client for the TAXII 2.0 server.  It supports the following TAXII 2.0 API services:

- Server Discovery
- Get API Root Information
- Get Status
- Get Collections
- Get a Collection
- Get Objects
- Add Objects
- Get an Object
- Get Object Manifests

`Installation`
==============

The easiest way to install the TAXII client is with pip::

  $ pip install taxii2-client


`Usage`
=======

The TAXII client is intended to be used as a Python library.  There is no support to run it independently.

.. code:: python

  import taxii2client

  client = taxii2client.TAXII2Client("http://taxii_server", "user_id", "user_password")

The authorization information is stored in the TAXII client instance, so it need not be supplied explicitly when request services.

Once you have instantiated a TAXII client, you can get all meta data about the contents of the TAXII server as follows:

.. code:: python

  client.populate_available_information()

This will cache the server's information in the client instance in instance variables:

- api_roots
- title
- description
- default_api_root

Each api_root found on the server will be instantiated with its meta data

- name
- collections
- information

Each collection found in an api_root will be instantiated with its meta data

- media_types
- title
- can_write
- can_read
- description
